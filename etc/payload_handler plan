Headers:
  -> For CMD's construct header of form: "CMD <CMD_name> <body_size>"
  -> For MSG's construct body of form specific to the command (maybe create a digest command function)

Bodies:
  -> For CMD's send a '\n' delimited list of CMD parameters (this should never
     get larger than 1024 chars, use USERID instead of name)
      -> This means the client must maintain a list of users as well, to get USERID
  -> For MSG's break text into 1024 chars and send them one at a time until the
     whole message has been sent (make sure the only \0 char is at the end of the text)

ACTUAL EXECUTION OF THESE CMD'S SHOULD BE DONE IN ITS OWN FILE
