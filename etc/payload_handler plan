Headers:
  -> For CMD's construct header of form: "<CMD_name> <body_size>"

Bodies:
  -> For CMD's send a '\n' delimited list of CMD parameters (this should never
     get larger than 1024 chars, THIS MIGHT CHANGE NOW THAT MSG'S ARE CMD'S)
      -> This means the client must maintain a list of users as well, to get USERID

ACTUAL EXECUTION OF THESE CMD'S SHOULD BE DONE IN ITS OWN FILE
