Server plan:
*This can likely be improved via PTHREADs so that MSG's can be received from multiple clients at once, and sent simultaneously*

main loop {
	checkforconns();
	checkforrecv();
	propogaterecv();
}

Checkforconns:
	- Check to see if there are any incoming connections, and if they are add them to a linked list of struct Client's
	- Checks to see if open Clients are indeed still open, and if they are not remove them from the linked list

Checkforrecv:
	- Checks to see if there are any incoming messeges (with nonblocking sockets!) from list of Clients
		-> These would be a header of a set size (*256* should work)
			-> Header would contain either MSG or CMD, and a send-time timestamp
		-> If there are MSG's, add them to a priority queue based on timestamp
		-> If there are CMD's, execute the command

PropogateRecv: -----------------------------------------------------------> THIS NEEDS MORE WORK
	- Send all recieved MSG's to all open clients in the linked list
		-> Should likely be done with a HEADER : BODY structure
