Commands: (commands can be identified by placing a '!' at the front of the text to be sent with '\' as the escape char)
Commands have a lowercase identifier, which is what the client will use to invoke them, ex. "!exit", "!h"
Commands also have an 8 character, uppercase identifier which is what will actually be sent in the CMD header, ex. "DSCNCLNT", "HELPMENU"

User CMD's - Only used by the end user
  - SENDMESG; default when no ! character is found at the beginning of the entered text
    -> quite literally meant to send plain text
      (arg0: timestamp)
      (arg1: MSG)

Joint CMD's - Require action from user and server
  - exit - DSCNCLNT; disconnects a client from the server gracefully
    -> returns confirmation and goodbye MSG

  - mute (<client_name> | <client_id>) - MUTECLNT; prevents sending client from recv'ing MSG's from <client_name>
    -> returns confirmation if <client_name> is found
    -> returns disconfirmation if <client_name> is not found

  - unmute (<client_name> | <client_id> | "ALL"){, } - UNMTCLNT; unmutes specifed clients
    -> returns affirmation for found <client_name>'s
      -> or returns affirmation that all <#_of_muted_clients> were unmuted
    -> returns disconfirmation for not found <client_names>'s

Sys CMD's - Used in the background, not to be invoked by the user EVER!
  - UPDTUSRS; Tells the client to update its list of clients connected to the room
    -> This should be called to ensure server and client list is synchronized
    -> Client side only needs to store Name, ID, and MUTE_STATUS
  - HSHKINIT; Initializes the handshake protocol
    -> Server to Client
      (arg0: server_name)
  - HSHKRECV; Response for the handshake protocol
    -> Client to server
      (arg0: client_name)
      (arg1: timestamp)

Local CMD's - Invoked by the user, but does not require server action
  - listusers - returns list of all users connected to the room
    -> USERID
    -> CLIENT_NAME
    -> MUTE_STATUS
  - (help | h) - returns list of all possible commands
