Commands: (commands can be identified by placing a '!' at the front of the text to be sent with '\' as the escape char)
Commands have a lowercase identifier, which is what the client will use to invoke them, ex. "!exit", "!h"
Commands also have an 8 character, uppercase identifier which is what will actually be sent in the CMD header, ex. "DSCNCLNT", "HELPMENU"

Joint CMD's - Require action from user and server
  - exit - DSCNCLNT; disconnects a client from the server gracefully
    -> returns confirmation and goodbye MSG

  - mute (<client_name> | <client_id>) - MUTECLNT; prevents sending client from recv'ing MSG's from <client_name>
    -> returns confirmation if <client_name> is found
    -> returns disconfirmation if <client_name> is not found

  - unmute (<client_name> | <client_id> | "ALL"){, } - UNMTCLNT; unmutes specifed clients
    -> returns affirmation for found <client_name>'s
      -> or returns affirmation that all <#_of_muted_clients> were unmuted
    -> returns disconfirmation for not found <client_names>'s

Sys CMD's - Used in the background, not to be invoked by the user EVER!
  - UPDTUSRS; Tells the client to update its list of clients connected to the room
    -> This should be called to ensure server and client list is synchronized

  - listusers - returns list of all users connected to the room
    -> USERID
