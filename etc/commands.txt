Commands: (commands can be identified by placing a '!' at the front of the text to be sent with '\' as the escape char)
Commands have a lowercase identifier, which is what the client will use to invoke them, ex. "!exit", "!h"
Commands also have an 8 character, uppercase identifier which is what will actually be sent in the CMD header, ex. "DSCNCLNT", "HELPMENU"
