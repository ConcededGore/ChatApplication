1:
- Refactor server code to output a Client struct when listening for a connection, such that said struct can be added to a linked list
- Implement Server plan

2:
- Multithread Client so that it can listen for MSG's and output text at the same time
- Multithread Server so it can listen for conns and MSG's, send out MSG's, and execute CMD's at the same time

3:
- Create a script to generate and digest headers and bodies (for both MSG's and CMD's)
- Refactor option_parser to be more in line with the top down parser I implemented last semester (this will make it more legible and extensible)
- Create a way interpret and execute CMD's
